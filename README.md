    You need to add Pantheon to the list of desktops abled to work with indicators :<br/>

  - With autostart (thanks to JMoerman)

      just add /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-application/indicator-application-service as custom command to the auto start applications in the system settings.
      >   System settings -> "Applications" -> "Startup" -> "Add Startup Appâ€¦" -> "Type in a custom command".

  - With the terminal (thanks to ankurk91)

      Open Terminal and run the following commands.
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
      cp /etc/xdg/autostart/indicator-application.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
      sed -i 's/^OnlyShowIn.*/OnlyShowIn=Unity;GNOME;Pantheon;/' ~/.config/autostart/indicator-application.desktop
      ```

  - Editing files (change system settings!)

      ```sudo vi /etc/xdg/autostart/indicator-application.desktop```  

      Search the parameter: OnlyShowIn= and add "Pantheon" at the end of the line:  
      >OnlyShowIn=Unity;GNOME;Pantheon;  

      Save your changes (`:wq` save the changes).

3. reboot
